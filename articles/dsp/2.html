          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Signal processing lies at the heart of modern engineering and technology, enabling a range of applications from wireless communication to biomedical imaging. Advanced signal processing techniques, characterized by their sophistication and adaptability, are pivotal in addressing complex challenges in diverse domains.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>1. Compressed Sensing</h2>
          <p><strong>Compressed sensing</strong> leverages the sparsity of signals to recover them from fewer samples than dictated by the Nyquist-Shannon theorem. This paradigm shift has revolutionized fields like medical imaging and sensor networks. The key techniques include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sparse Representations:</strong> Transforming signals into domains where they exhibit sparsity (e.g., wavelet or Fourier domains).</li>
            <li><strong>Reconstruction Algorithms:</strong> Techniques like Basis Pursuit and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit ensure accurate signal recovery.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>\[ \min \|x\|_1 \text{ subject to } Ax = b \]</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>2. Adaptive Filtering</h2>
          <p>Adaptive filters dynamically adjust their parameters based on input data, making them ideal for environments with non-stationary signals. Applications range from echo cancellation to financial time series analysis. Key algorithms include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Least Mean Squares (LMS):</strong> A computationally efficient algorithm for minimizing error.</li>
            <li><strong>Recursive Least Squares (RLS):</strong> Offers faster convergence at the cost of higher complexity.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>\[ w(n+1) = w(n) + 2\mu e(n)x(n) \]</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>3. Multirate Signal Processing</h2>
          <p>Multirate processing involves manipulating signals at different sampling rates, enabling efficient data handling and processing. Key components include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Downsampling:</strong> Reducing the sampling rate for efficient storage and transmission.</li>
            <li><strong>Upsampling:</strong> Increasing the sampling rate to restore high-frequency components.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>\[ y[n] = x[2n] \]</p>
          <p>Applications include sub-band coding in audio compression and filter banks in wavelet transforms.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>4. Blind Source Separation</h2>
          <p>Blind source separation (BSS) techniques disentangle mixed signals into their original components without prior knowledge of the sources. The cornerstone methods include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Independent Component Analysis (ICA):</strong> Assumes statistical independence of sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF):</strong> Suitable for non-negative data such as image and audio signals.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>\[ X = AS \]</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>5. Time-Frequency Analysis</h2>
          <p>Conventional Fourier analysis struggles with non-stationary signals. Time-frequency techniques address this limitation by offering localized frequency information. Popular methods include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT):</strong> Analyzes signals using overlapping windows.</li>
            <li><strong>Wavelet Transform:</strong> Decomposes signals into components with varying resolutions in time and frequency.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>\[ STFT(x(t)) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau)w(\tau-t)e^{-j\omega\tau} d\tau \]</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Advanced signal processing techniques are indispensable in modern technological advancements, driving innovation across fields. By mastering these techniques, one can unlock new opportunities for research and practical implementations.</p>
